## About The Project

## Getting Started

Firstly, you have to [invite Remix](https://app.revolt.chat/bot/01FVB28WQ9JHMWK8K7RD0F0VCW). Then use the `%help` command to get a list of commands that you can use through the bot.

<!-- TODO: more extensive tutorial -->

## Hosting The Bot

If you're self-hosting Remix, please make it clear that it is **not the main instance** (or **change the name**) but give credit by **linking to this repo** (for example, in the bot's profile - something like `This bot <is based on/is an instance of> [Remix](https://github.com/remix-bot/revolt)` will suffice).

-   Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/remix-bot/revolt.git)`)
-   Install the dependencies (`npm install`)
-   Set up a `config.json` file
    - Rename the `config.example.json` file and fill out the missing values. You can generate spotify credentials [here](https://developer.spotify.com/)
-   Run the bot (`node index.js`)

## Connecting To A Self-Hosted Instance

If you don't want to connect to the official Revolt instance, you need to fill out the `revolt.js` and `revolt-api` configuration values in your config file.

Please refer to the [revolt.js docs](https://revolt.js.org/classes/Client.html#constructor) for `revolt.js` and to [oapi's docs](https://github.com/insertish/oapi#example) for `revolt-api`.
